# CS1660 Project Option 2

NOTE: I've only tested this on a Mac.
## Steps:

1) Clone or Download this repository
2) Open up the terminal/command prompt and `cd` into the location of where you downloaded it _example: cd Desktop/CS1660_P2_
3) Enter `docker-compose build`
4) Once it is done, enter `docker-compose up -d` for a cleaner output on the terminal of what services are loaded and ready to go. 
5) Open up your web browser and navigate to _http:/localhost:5000/_
6) From there, you should be able to open each link listed on the web page
